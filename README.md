# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

Diabetes is a prevalent metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels over an extended period. If left untreated, it can lead to various complications such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney disease, and eye damage. Early detection and prediction of diabetes can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce the risk of complications.


## Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a patient has diabetes based on the provided diagnostic measurements.
